            <h3>Programming</h3>
            <p>I've spent a lot of my time recently diving into all things tech. <br> I attended a bootcamp at Eleven Fifty Academy to learn all about becoming a fullstack developer and it has changed my life. <br>
            We received a solid foundation on all aspects of the craft, and now the future seems bright with possibilty!</p>

            <h3>Music!!!</h3>
            <p>One of the pillars of my life has been my passion and deication to music. <br>  My late uncle gifted me my first guitar long ago and it just became my identity. <br>
            I've now spent over 20 years cultivating this part of my career. <br> I've produced, written, and performed music that can be found on all major streaming platforms, and I have no plans of slowing down. <br>
